# COMP3023 Final - AimTrainer
## Assets & Source Files
Most assets are pregenerated from the First Person Shooter Template offered on Unreal Engine. Other assets were obtained from the Epic Games Store for free, and were apart of a pack titled "Creating a First-Person Aim Trainer". Characters were made in Blender and MakeHuman, then imported to Unreal Engine by me.
